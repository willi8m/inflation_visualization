    "    - Examine CPI trends by sector.  \n",
    "    - Analyze CPI changes during Democratic and Republican administrations.  \n",
    "    - Explore the impact of COVID-19 on inflation and Federal Reserve rates.  \n",
    "    - Highlight key geopolitical events influencing inflation and interest rates.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This cell performs CPI forecasting for the years 2024â€“2026 using an ARIMA model. It also calculates inflation rates and plots the forecasted values alongside the observed CPI.\n",

    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:  \n",
    "   - The `urban_consumers_cleaned` dataset is used to extract the average monthly CPI values.  \n",
    "   - This data serves as input for the ARIMA model.\n",
    "2. **ARIMA Model Fitting**:  \n",
    "   - An ARIMA(1,1,1) model is applied to the prepared data.  \n",
    "   - The order (1,1,1) can be tuned further based on AIC/BIC values for better accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Forecasting**:  \n",
    "   - CPI values are forecasted for 36 months (January 2024 to December 2026).  \n",
    "   - A DataFrame is created to store the forecasted CPI values along with their corresponding dates and years.\n",
    "4. **Annualized CPI Calculation**:  \n",
    "   - The forecasted monthly CPI values are averaged to obtain annualized CPI for each forecasted year (2024â€“2026).\n",
    "5. **Inflation Rate Calculation**:  \n",
    "   - Inflation rates are calculated for 2024â€“2025, 2025â€“2026, and the cumulative inflation rate for the entire period (2024â€“2026).\n",
    "6. **Visualization**:  \n",
    "   - Observed CPI values (historical) and forecasted CPI values (2024â€“2026) are plotted together for comparison.  \n",
    "   - The plot includes labels, legends, and gridlines for better interpretability.\n",
    "7. **Forecast Summary Creation**:  \n",
    "   - A summary table is generated to display annualized CPI and inflation rates.  \n",
    "   - The cumulative inflation rate for 2024â€“2026 is added as a separate row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To predict future CPI trends under the assumption of stable Federal Reserve policies.  \n",
    "- To calculate expected inflation rates for decision-making and analysis.  \n",
    "- To visualize the trajectory of CPI over the forecasted period alongside historical trends.\n"

    "4. **Dual-Axis Plot Creation**:\n",

    "   - CPI is plotted on the left y-axis to show inflation trends.  \n",

    "   - Vertical lines and text annotations mark the timing of key events.\n",

    "5. **Visualization Customization**:\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Trends\n",
    "* CPI (Urban Consumers):\n",
    "  * The blue line shows a steady increase in the CPI, with a noticeable acceleration starting around 2021. This reflects the significant inflation experienced during the post-COVID recovery period.\n",
    "  * The increase aligns with known supply chain disruptions, fiscal stimulus, and a surge in consumer demand.\n",
    "* Federal Funds Rate:\n",
    "  * The orange dashed line highlights how the Federal Funds Rate remained at near-zero levels from 2020 to 2021, reflecting the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy during the pandemic.\n",
    "  * Starting in 2022, the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising rates to combat rising inflation, culminating in the steep increases observed in 2022 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Events Highlighted\n",
    "* COVID-19 Pandemic (2020):\n",
    "  * The pandemic's onset is marked with a vertical line.\n",
    "  * During this period, CPI growth slows, and the Federal Funds Rate is slashed to near-zero levels to stimulate the economy.\n",
    "  * Inflationary pressures remained subdued initially due to economic contraction.\n",
    "* Start of Rate Hikes (2022):\n",
    "  * This marks the Federal Reserve's shift in policy as inflation surged.\n",
    "  * The sharp increase in the Federal Funds Rate coincides with the steep rise in CPI observed in 2022 and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations and Insights \n",
    "* Delayed Policy Response:\n",
    "  * The Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates until inflation became significantly pronounced (2021â€“2022).\n",
    "  * The rate hikes in 2022 were reactive rather than preemptive, reflecting the challenge of forecasting post-pandemic economic conditions.\n",
    "* CPI Trends and Monetary Policy:\n",
    "  * CPI continues to rise in 2022 despite rate hikes, illustrating the lag between monetary policy actions and their impact on inflation.\n",
    "  * This aligns with the economic principle that rate hikes take time (often 6â€“12 months) to affect inflation.\n",
    "* Post-Pandemic Recovery:\n",
    "  * The CPI increase from 2021 onward is attributed to:\n",
    "  * Supply chain disruptions.\n",
    "  * Increased consumer demand fueled by fiscal stimulus.\n",
    "  * Rising costs of energy and commodities.\n",
    "* Policy Tightening in 2022:\n",
