Inflation and Federal Reserve Rate Analysis: 1954–Present
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Federal Reserve's interest rates from 1954 to the present. By examining trends, anomalies, and historical correlations, we aim to understand how rate adjustments influence inflation. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of geopolitical events and Federal Reserve policies, particularly during Jerome Powell's tenure as Chair of the Federal Reserve.

Objectives:

1. Data Analysis and Visualization:

    Examine CPI trends by sector.
    Analyze CPI changes during different Presidential administrations (Democrats vs. Republicans).
    Explore the impact of COVID-19 on inflation and Federal Reserve rates.
    Highlight geopolitical events affecting inflation/rates during the time period.

2. Correlation Analysis:

    Calculate correlation coefficients between CPI and Federal Reserve rates.

3. Forecasting:
    Predict CPI trends for 2024–2026, accounting for Jerome Powell’s policy adjustments.

4. Powell Administration Analysis:

    Evaluate the effectiveness of Powell’s policies and their impact on inflation and rates.

Data Sources

Predictions
- We anticipate that recent rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve will contribute to a decrease in inflation. However, forecasting remains challenging due to economic and political uncertainties.
